# sql-challenge

In this Module 9 Challenge I had to design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. 

In the Data Modeling part I used QuickDBD tool. I created the tables and relationships between them. 

In the Data Engineering part I specified the data types, primary and foreign keys, and other constrains. After the diagram was created I imported it as postgreSQL file, opened it in pgAdmin and ran the schemata which created the required tables.

In Data Analysis part I performed all 8 queries and they showed the required information. 

Then I saved both, schemata and queries, as .sql files, took screenshot of QuickDBD diagram (to export the diagram as .png it has to be done through Google Chrome but I was using Safari on MacBook), and pushed them to the GitHub.
